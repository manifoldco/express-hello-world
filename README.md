# Express example app

![](./.github/express-hello-world.png)

## ðŸ”§ Setup

First install all dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then start the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Youâ€™ll be up and running at `localhost:3001`. Logging things will log straight to Node.jsâ€™ `stdout`,
but when deployed on Render, everything you log here will go straight to your
[provisioned LogDNA instance](https://dashboard.render.com/addons)!
